# Agent6

This github contains (almost) all the assets used in the Agent No. 6 game, made for the Game-Off 2022 Gamejam. The game was made within the Unity Game Engine. 

All the sound effects are originally from https://freesound.org/, altough modified. All the other assets are custom made for this project, are unlicenced and free to use. I did however not upload the full game. The music, scenes, materials en prefabs are missing, as for some small files. 

Keep in mind this was a gamejam project. Some scripts such as the "PlayerController", are not refactorized and thus very unreadable.

You can find the game at: https://jaimejaime.itch.io/agent-no-6
