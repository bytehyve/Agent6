# Agent6

This github contains all the assets used in the Agent No. 6 game, made for the Game-Off 2022 Gamejam. The game was made within the Unity Game Engine. 

All the sound effects are originally from https://freesound.org/, altough modified. All the other assets, including the music, are custom made for this project, are unlicenced and free to use.

Keep in mind this was a gamejam project. Some scripts like the "PlayerController" are not refactorized and thus very unreadable.

You can find the game at: https://jaimejaime.itch.io/agent-no-6
